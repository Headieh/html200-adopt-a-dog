# HTML200-adopt-a-dog | Course Project

 This is the final project of the JavaScript & Responsive Design course of the University of Washingtonâ€™s
 Front End Web Development Program. This website was built using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript and JQuery.  

 # Project Purpose

 The purpose of this project was to utilize skills learned in this class, using a mockup for basic design.
 Originally the site was designed with just HTML5 and CSS. Later, Javascript and JQuery were used to add responsiveness to the site.

 # Site Purpose

 Adoptadog.com is a website that helps users browse dogs that are available for adoption and make adopting easier for the user. It also features a blog with useful information
 for owners. It provides information about the dog prior to adoption so prospective owners can learn more about them before deciding to adopt.
