USERS
   Someone seeking a new dog to adopt.
   Dogs require daily walks, and for this reason the site user is probably not elderly but is over the age of 18.
   They could be a young person living on their own, or a couple seeking to get a dog to grow their family.
   Users of this site will probably be active internet users and likely have laptops and smartphones with Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox.

TESTING
   To test the site, I went to the main page on multiple browsers on multiple operating systems. I clicked on all the links and had no issues.
   I checked the javascript and jQuery by looking at the popup windows that displayed correctly, however the shopping cart total and adopt popup didn't display out 2 decimal points so I updated my code.
   Hovering on the dog tile images behaved as expected.
   I had no errors in the navigation and the form console logged the data correctly once submitted.
   When filling out the form, I tested to confirm that the alert appeared and console displayed correct information after submitting.
   Lastly, I verified responsiveness by adjusting the page size, tilting the devices and utilizing the inspect window.
